The frontend has been developed using Angular(Typescript), a robust and widely used framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs). The project leverages Angular’s component-based architecture to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Key features implemented in the frontend include:

- Responsive UI: Ensures the application works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

- Routing and Navigation: Smooth client-side navigation using Angular’s Router module.

- Forms and Validation: Interactive forms with built-in validation for improved user experience.

- Service Integration: Communication with backend APIs via Angular’s HttpClient for data fetching and submission.

- Reusable Components: Components are structured for reusability and easier maintenance.
